    "- Per <https://eloratings.net/about>, the K constant is set to 50 as this is a continental competition.  \n",
    "- Probabilities given by the Elo rating system are binary. I came up with a workaround to convert them to ternary probabilities given that association football (a.k.a. soccer) admits three outcomes after a match (win, tie, lose).  \n",
    "- I did not simulate scorelines. Rather, I simply used probabilities to decide whether a team would win, tie, or lose. As such, I did not use the goal difference multiplier specified in <https://eloratings.net/about>  \n",
    "- I'll be happy to talk about the workaround, but I wouldn't take it as gospel. There might be ways to do this, but I did not research it. Wanted to have fun, not produce an academic-paper-worthy method, nor a sellable product.  \n",
    "- In the end, results aren't that different from other more publicized methods. Brazil is a strong team... always."

    "- Group C: England should definitely qualify, but it's hard to tell how the teams will sort themselves out since there's overlaps in the 99% confidence intervals between England and Denmark, and between Denmark and Serbia, and between Serbia and Slovenia. I'll call the shots here and say: England, Denmark, Serbia, Slovenia. While there's overlap, it's not like the overlaps in group A and B, where three teams are in the mix. Here, the overals are between two teams at a time.  \n",
    "- Group D: Easy, should be France and Netherlands, in that order. I'll call the shot and say Austria will come in third, but there is a chance Poland might take that spot.  \n",
    "- Group E: Apparently, Belgium should *easily* top this group... followed by Ukraine... And the fight should be between Slovakia and Romania for third place. But if we learned anything from the first match date, this might turn out to be super wrong.  \n",
